        <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', 'Comic Sans', cursive;">Hello! My name is Marissa, I use She/Her pronouns, and I am a senior at CU Boulder.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I am very excited to be taking Web this semester, as it is the last course I need for my CTD minor and is by far the course I was most interested in when I began taking ATLAS clases. I enjoy software development and am excited to further my understanding of html and css.</p> <!-- Change NAME to your name! -->
